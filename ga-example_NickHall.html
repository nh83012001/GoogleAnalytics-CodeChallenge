    <!-- This is a real world example -->

    <!-- For Google Analytics, you receive a snippet of code that is supposed to go at the top of the body statement,
    it looks like this:

        <script>
            (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
            (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),
            m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)
            })(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');

            ga('create', 'UA-XXXXXXXX-X', 'auto');
            ga('send', 'pageview');
        </script>

    Now this will not run correctly, because you are running it in an .html page and not from a server
    but for simplicity sake, we are going to spoof it running.  It will inject the script tag below, -->

    <!-- <script async="" src="https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js"></script> -->

    <!--  , to call Google Analytics so that it will fire an event, you make a function call like this:

    window.ga('send', 'event', {eventCategory: 'exampleCategory', eventAction: 'exampleAction'});

    But also in the analytics.js script tag above, you can clearly see the async="" attribute.  That causes funky issues.  Namely,
    what if I call window.ga before it is defined?  Because of the async="" that can happen.

    The second issue is that while window.ga can be defined, it may not be fully loaded.  To check if Google Analytics
    is fully loaded you would check:
    if (window.ga.loaded) {}
    or
    if (window.ga.loaded === true) {}

    Modify the code below so:
    A) When window.ga isn't loaded, we save the events that are supposed to be sent to Google Analytics
    B) When window.ga is defined and window.ga.loaded === true that the events will be sent to Google Analytics in the
    order that they were fired below (1-5).
    C) Imagine the userClicked function passing in MainCategory-4, and MainCategory-5 were never called, how do you
    still set this up so that 1-3 are fired when window.ga.loaded is finally true?  (That means to comment out these lines:

        setTimeout(function() {
            userClicked(eventData(4));
            userClicked(eventData(5));
        }, 500);

    )

    I will indicate where to start and stop modifying code -->
    <script async="" src="https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js"></script>

    <script type="text/javascript">
        function userClicked(eventData) {
            window.ga('send', 'event', eventData)
        }

        // ONLY START MODIFYING CODE BELOW THIS LINE

        const gaQueuedEvents = [];//empty array to store eventdata when GA isn't fully loaded
        if (!window.ga) { //using not operator to check if window.ga is undefined/falsey
        window.ga = function(send,ev,eventData) { //defining the window.ga as a function that pushes the eventData to an array
            gaQueuedEvents.push(eventData)
          }
        }

        function async(sendingQueueFunct) {
          const scriptArray = document.getElementsByTagName('script')//HTML collection of all scripts being loaded
          const arr = Array.prototype.slice.call(scriptArray)//turning HTML collection into an array
          arr.forEach(function(scriptElement){//itterating through array of scripts on the hunt for analytics
          if (scriptElement.src = 'https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js'){//finding analytics script
              scriptElement.addEventListener('load', function (e) { sendingQueueFunct(null, e); }, false)//adding event listener and sending events on load
            }
          })
        }

        //Using function above to addEventListener for load. Once loaded, I itterate and send the event data same way as in line 58
        if (!window.ga.loaded){//making sure that window.ga.loaded doesn't exist before sending to function adding event listener
          async(function() {
          gaQueuedEvents.forEach(function(evData){
            window.ga('send', 'event', evData)
          })
      })
    }
        // DO NOT MODIFY CODE BELOW THIS LINE

        //This is the spoofed event data to pass into Google Analytics
        function eventData(num) {
            return {
                eventCategory: 'MainCategory-' + num,
                eventAction: 'User clicked'
            }
        }

        //This is the spoofed user clicking that would trigger us sending an event into Google Analytics
        userClicked(eventData(1));
        userClicked(eventData(2));
        userClicked(eventData(3));
        //We are waiting 500milliseconds to set window.ga.loaded to true

        setTimeout(function() {
            //Spoofing that loaded is true because it will never be true if you are just running a .html file
            if (window.ga) { window.ga.loaded = true;}

            //After 500 more milliseconds we are spoofing the user clicking twice more
            setTimeout(function() {
                userClicked(eventData(4));
                userClicked(eventData(5));
